This project explores logistics and supply chain data using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques in R. It investigates shipment performance, delivery timelines, inventory flow, and supplier efficiency to identify patterns and guide operational decisions.

Project Objectives; Examine delivery efficiency and fulfillment trends -- Analyze shipping delays, inventory costs, and regional performance -- Visualize supplier behavior and demand variability -- Generate actionable insights through data storytelling

 Tools & Packages; R (v4.x) -- tidyverse – data wrangling & visualization -- lubridate – working with dates and time -- ggplot2 & plotly – static and interactive plots -- readr, dplyr, janitor – data import and cleaning -- Developed in Visual Studio Code using the R extension

 Project Files; logistics_supply_chain_analysis.R – Main script for cleaning, EDA, and visualizations -- data/logistics_data.csv – Dataset used in the analysis -- plots/ – Optional folder for saving charts and graphics -- README.md – Documentation

 How to Run; Clone this repository -- Open the .R file in VS Code or RStudio -- Install dependencies in R -- Run the script line by line to reproduce the analysis and visuals

Sample Analyses; Average delivery time by region and carrier -- Inventory turnover trends across suppliers -- Shipment delay patterns using boxplots and heatmaps -- Correlations between shipping cost and fulfillment rate
